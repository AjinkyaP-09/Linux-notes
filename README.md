This is a Linux-Notes repository that I am creating along with my Linux learning journey.
The whole repository is based on the Youtube Playlist by [Abhishek Veeramalla](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdpzxOOAlwvIBIRWcReRV-m2kgIW6V6gr)  on Linux called Linux Zero to Hero.
The concepts that are covered in this repository are:
1. Linux-folder-structure
2. Linux-user-&-file-management-and-vi-editor
